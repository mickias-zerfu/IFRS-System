Design and Develop IFRS System
International Financial Reporting Standards, usually called IFRS, are accounting standards issued by the 
IFRS Foundation and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to provide a common global 
language for business affairs so that company accounts are understandable and comparable across 
international boundaries. The absence of one set of accounting standards in the country, financial 
statements depict limited information for users which indicates the existence of the urgent need for Ethiopia 
to have a uniform standard. Since most of the countries in the world are following IFRS, Ethiopia should 
not isolate itself The Adoption of IFRS and current financial reporting system which is generally accepted 
accounting principles (GAAP) faces several challenges which include lack of technical skills and 
inadequate knowledge of companyâ€™s professional accountants with regarding how to implement the IFRS 
standards, Lack of comparative approach and international standardization, High implementation cost of 
IFRS, Lack of high level of accuracy and reliability which is needed in the financial sector and so on. The 
proposed system aims to present to provide financial information for making decisions. Those decisions 
include buying, selling, holding equity and debt instruments, providing loans and other forms of credit, 
exercising rights to vote on, otherwise influence management Subsequently. And we dive into some IFRS 
components are A statement of financial position, A statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive 
income, A statement of changes in equity, A statement of cash flows and Comparative information for the 
prior period is required for amounts shown in the financial statements. Our contribution is to design and 
develop Financial information that is more useful, International standardized, comparable, verifiable, 
timely, understandable and easy to use IFRS system . and also, our system provides Greater clarity and 
transparency of numbers and improved comparability of financial information with global competitors.
